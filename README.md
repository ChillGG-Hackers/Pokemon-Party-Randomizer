## Missing DLLs
If you're receiving errors that youre missing MSVCP110.dll I suggest you install the microsoft redistrubutables from 2012.
They are available from the microsoft website; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679
You might have to reboot your PC after installing these redistrubutables.
